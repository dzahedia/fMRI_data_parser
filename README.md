# fMRI_data_parser
Taking an fMRI data file, this program first extracts a table out of a row 
and then generates a csv file containing all the tables.

In a lab at uWaterloo, participants were shown 40 picture set,
each set containing 15 pictures. Researchers were interested in parts of data
generated for each picture. So, they wanted a table for each participant 
with 40*15=600 rows and 13 columns
